                <em>"The Flowers"</em> by Alice Walker, produced by students of PDLE 4 C1

                Each student reimagined the ending of the story, reflecting on themes such
                as innocence, memory, loss and hope. The following spreads present their

            <p>
              Myop stood motionless, gazing at the lifeless man on the ground.
              For an instant, she hoped he might still be alive. Filled with fear
              and compassion she ran back home to ask her parents and neighbors
              for help.
            </p>
            <p>
              When they arrived, they gently explained that nothing more could be
              done for him. Overcome with sadness, Myop asked them to plant a
              walnut tree where the man lay surrounded by daisies to honor his
              memory.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the years passed, the tree grew tall and strong and flowers
              bloomed each spring. For Myop, they became symbols not only of
              death, but also of memory, peace, and the enduring power of
              compassion.

            <h2>Acosta Nerina</h2>
            <p>
              Myop's mind started to spin restlessly as a lot of questions flooded her thoughts:
              Who was this poor man? What had happened to him? Why was his head on the side
              with all of his teeth broken? A freezing chill went down her spine. Who could be
              capable of such brutality? Who could have done such a thing?
            </p>
            <p>
              Everything around her seemed to blur. She felt queasy and weak, her stomach turned
              upside down.
            </p>
            <p>
              She ran blindly back to her house, blinded by tears, and told her mother what she
              had found in the woods. They hugged each other tightly for a while, tears streaming
              down their faces, and then they decided to return to the woods together.
            </p>
            <p>
              On their path, the mother started to tell her about the struggles that the Black
              community had had to face over time and how most of them were illegally murdered.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once they reached the spot, her mother picked up all the loose flowers while Myop
              looked down at the man and at her small dark hands.
            </p>
            <p>
              The flowers she had gathered no longer seemed bright and colourful as before;
              they now appeared frail, like everything alive.
            </p>
            <p>
              Suddenly, her mother started to sing a song Myop had never heard before, but it
              soothed her soul. Right there, with an armful of flowers, while holding her mother's
              hand, she realized that she belonged to a greater family. A sense of connection
              flourished beyond her small world.

              She showed no sign of fear. She spent a moment looking at the remains of what once
              had been a life. Her eyes were quiet, her mind blank—not because she understood,
              but because she didn’t need to. The rope, the rotted clothes, the bones – none of it
              frightened her. She had seen things like this before, in shadows, in silences that
              belonged to innocent people. She had always been on that side, where darkness and
              death had walked beside her.
            </p>
            <p>
              She picked two flowers: one for her mother, the other for the life silenced by man.
              When she stood up again, she contemplated the land—it was calm. Just another day,
              another place, the same story with a different victim. On her way back home, she
              understood she had never known summer. It had always been winter—not only for her,
              but for her brothers, her sisters, her people.

            <p>
              He was a tall man from his feet to his neck, covering a long space. His head lay beside him.
              When she pushed back the leaves and layers of earth and debris, Myop saw that he’d had large
              white teeth, all of them cracked or broken, long fingers and very big bones. All his clothes
              had rotted away except some threads of blue denim from his overalls. The buckles of the
              overall had turned green.
            </p>
            <p>
              Myop was disturbed; she gazed around the spot with interest. Very near where she’d stepped
              into the head, a colorful, shining, peaceful pillow of flowers grew up. Myop bent down to
              pick the most beautiful. A long brown and rough shape appeared between the colors, and
              Myop observed carefully. The body dragged slowly, hypnotizing and dancing on the ground.
            </p>
            <p>
              She stood up slowly, her eyes full of fear and never losing sight of the dancing body.
              The bouquet of flowers fell as Myop jumped quickly away: her skinny, short legs were
              brave enough to take her back home. The summer was over, and her flowers were forgotten.

              Myop laid down her flowers…
            </p>
            <p>
              A cold breeze brushed her skin like a warning, making her whole body shiver. Who was that
              person? The cloth looked familiar, as if she had seen it before. It might have been their
              family friendly neighbour who waved at them every time they met. Or the old man who sang
              in the church every Sunday. It could also be the young man who sold vegetables at the market.
              Even her father's brother was around that height too. Realization hit her suddenly. This
              person was someone's brother, father, or son, but now it was just bones and dirty clothes.
              The wind moved the trees around; a dry leaf flew around until it lay on top of the corpse.
              Soon there would be no more than dust, leaves, and bushes hiding the traces of man's cruelty.
            </p>
            <p>
              Myop picked up the flowers again. Slowly approaching, she placed them around the remains.
              Then she moved around and collected more, came back, and placed them next to the others,
              repeating her actions until she felt at peace. She gently covered him with flowers, not to
              hide the truth but to show a last gesture of respect. She did not know who this person was,
              but just leaving it as it was did not feel right. The moment she turned around and walked
              home, the wind moved gently through the trees, as if saying farewell.
            </p>
            <p>
              Myop reached her house as the sky shaded in red and orange. The sun was hiding, and she
              felt cold but calm in the silent afternoon. The smell of cornbread and sweet potatoes filled
              the air. Inside, her mother was finishing dinner while her father was resting on his chair.
              The atmosphere felt heavy. He looked straight into her eyes; he was not old yet his eyes
              reflected years of wisdom. With trembling voices they told her to be cautious, never to
              wander alone, and always to return home before sunset. She understood their despair. She
              was now aware of the world, its beauty and its cruelty, but she believed that there were
              small ways one could show kindness. Even though she didn't know him, she understood that
              no one deserved to be abandoned like that.I also intend to keep the message of loss of innocence in
              a positive way, recognizing that she needs to be careful in this society but never lose her kindness.

              Myop froze for a long moment, staring at the broken face beneath the leaves; she couldn’t
              even scream. The forest felt heavier now, but the fear in her chest slowly changed into
              something else. She grabbed the flowers in her hand, strong and determined. Instead of
              leaving them beside the dead man, she turned around and began to run as fast as she could.
              The air around her seemed darker, the atmosphere was spooky, but the way back home was
              clear and vibrant. At that moment, she knew she was doing the right thing… running? No!
              Not abandoning anyone… even dead.
            </p>
            <p>
              When she reached her family’s cabin, she called her mother and father and told them what
              she had found. Her parents walked to the place, silent and solemn. When they saw the
              remains, they decided to give the man a dignified burial. They buried the man together
              under a big tree. Later, Myop came and placed her flowers gently on the ground, promising
              never to forget that moment. That night, as the moon shone, Myop felt something new
              growing inside her: not fear, not sadness… but understanding and strength.

              And the summer was over for Myop. It had lasted a whole decade, to her family’s delight,
              for her mother had no memory of such innocent, joyful moments in her almost three decades
              on earth. Perhaps the day little Myop was born had been a brief spring in her life — oh,
              how much she had prayed to God for a baby to love and care for, and oh, how bitterly she
              had wept when she realized what she had done; condemning that little bundle of love to so
              much pain and cruelty.
            </p>
            <p>
              Myop came home that day and told her mother about what she had seen. At first, she muttered
              loose words that made no sense — “woods… big man… scary… rope…” — and then, fully sobbing,
              she finally understood it all: “Dead, Mama!”
            </p>
            <p>
              The steady, gentle shuck-shuck of the corn as her mother peeled it stopped, and the yellow,
              tired hands of her progenitor gathered her into a crushing hug. And double the tears were
              shed — Myop’s, heavy with fear, confusion and sadness; and her mother’s, full of guilt and
              grief. Not for the poor man who remained in the forest — there came a time when one grew
              used to such deaths — but for her little innocent child, and for the end of her laughter.
              The world outside their cabin had claimed another piece of joy, as it always did. Myop’s
              mother held her tighter, rocking her as the last light of afternoon slid through the cracks
              in the boards. In the yard, the half-shucked corn lay scattered, yellow and soft against
              the dust.
            </p>
            <p>
              When Myop finally slept that night, her small hands still smelled faintly of flowers and
              soil. Her mother sat awake beside the dying fire, staring into the dark, thinking of all
              the summers that had ended before their time.

            <p>
              Myop started wandering back toward the house, back to the quiet of the morning. It was then
              that she saw a little girl with skin as pale as snow and hair like gold, picking some orange
              lilies from the ground. She looked at Myop with a friendly smile and asked her if she wanted
              to come to her house and play with her. Myop accepted enthusiastically. While they walked
              through the forest, a gloomy shadow flew over the girl's footprints slowly.
            </p>
            <p>
              After walking to the track, Myop observed a luxurious house with amazement. Suddenly, the
              little girl’s innocent face twisted into a wicked smile; she picked up a rock from the ground
              and struck her on the head with brutal force. Myop felt how her body was lifted from the
              ground and a noose stroked her neck. Through her half-closed eyes, she saw the little girl’s
              wide, eerie grin — a big creepy smile — looking at her and holding the blue flowers with
              velvety ridges in the middle of the mob, before her gaze sank into eternity.

            <p>
              Myop stopped and looked at the bones under the big oak tree. Something shiny caught her
              attention: a small old locket in the dirt. She picked it up, and when she opened it, there
              was a tiny photo of a smiling family inside, but the picture was faded and hard to see.
            </p>
            <p>
              Myop didn't know who they were, however, she felt an invading and overwhelming emotion:
              sadness. Her heart shattered, and she felt the need to put the locket back beside the man.
              She decided to plant the flowers she had found around him. She dug little holes with her
              stick and placed the flowers carefully in the ground.
            </p>
            <p>
              After finishing, she whispered, “Now you have flowers again.” Then she walked home slowly,
              holding one last flower in her hand. That night, she put it next to her bed and thought
              about the man and the tree. She didn't feel afraid, just thoughtful and quiet, because she
              had returned the love that had been torn away from someone.

            <p>
              Some obscuring clouds drifted slowly, and the woods grew dark around the oak. Myop took
              some time to look from the noose, frayed and evil above her, to the bones and the green
              overall buckles below. Instantly, she could no longer feel the warmth of the sun. Instead,
              she felt as though her heart had sunk in her chest, and her favorite melody could no longer
              echo in her head.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overwhelmed, her body began to yield under the sheer weight of her sorrow. She couldn’t
              know who he was, but his overall was familiar to her. Laying her sprigs down — not as an
              act of surrender but as an act of love and compassion — she felt the need, on the spur of
              the moment, to break the silence and speak to him. And her voice, soft as her own,
              delicately sang to him.
            </p>
            <p>
              “I’m sorry I stepped on your nose,” she timidly said. “These are the flowers I picked up
              from my walk. Now I feel as if I had carefully chosen them for you.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Suddenly, as she slowly straightened with tears in her eyes, a new, hard determination set
              in her ten-year-old face. Full of inspiration, she whispered to the skull, "Your name won't
              be forgotten in this dirt."
            </p>
            <p>
              As a final act, she took her knobby stick and used it to cover the man's exposed skull with
              damp leaves. Then, she rearranged the remnants of the noose and slowly coiled it neatly
              beneath the spreading oak.
            </p>
            <p>
              Without hesitation, she found herself purposefully leading, not toward the comfort of home,
              but toward the distant lights of her community. She would not sleep nor eat until her
              mother and father, and all the neighbors, had come to the woods. He would have a name, he
              would have a proper burial, and she would demand to know, "Why do they see us as if we were
              so different? Why do they mistreat us?"
            </p>
            <p>
              And the struggle had begun.

              Myop gazed around the spot with interest. Myop stood still for a very long time,
              staring at the man's broken skull. The sun no longer felt hot to her, and the flowers
              in her hand no longer felt pretty. Her heart raced, but not from fear, instead from an
              overall new, heavy comprehension—that this land she loved so much had secrets and
              stories it never shared, that were deeply planted like tree roots in the earth.
            </p>
            <p>
              She ran home, the flowers dispersed behind her as she went. Later that evening, in the
              fading light, Myop sat at the table with her mother and her grandmother and told them
              everything. They listened in silence and then between them they sang a song she had never
              heard about men and women who took and beat and killed their kind because their skin was
              black like the dirt that covered the flowers she loved.
            </p>
            <p>
              “It isn’t fair,” Myop whispered. “Why didn’t anybody stop it?”
            </p>
            <p>
              "Because too many people knew it was wrong and said nothing," her grandmother sighed.
              "But you must not be one of them."
            </p>
            <p>
              From that night on, Myop saw her world differently. She understood that courage was not
              just about being brave in the woods, it was about speaking up when silence was easier.
              Like Atticus Finch standing alone in a courtroom, she learned that justice could only grow
              if someone was willing to plant the first seed, even in hard soil.
            </p>
            <p>
              And so, the summer did not truly end; it transformed. It became the season Myop began to
              see, to question, and to dream of a world where no one’s story would be buried and
              forgotten.

              These rewrites grew out of one short story, but they opened many paths: memory,
              resistance, grief, community, and the fragile beauty of childhood. Each voice here
              reimagines Myop’s walk through the woods from a different angle, linking literature
              to history and to the present.
            </p>

              In PDLE 4 C1, creative writing becomes a space to question violence, to honour lives
              erased from official narratives, and to explore how language can protect, denounce,
              and heal. We hope these pages invite further reading, discussion and new stories
              still to be written.
